                    You saved Y ${tax} {exists} in taxes, and were able to acquire him the ${liquidFunds} he needed. He invested all that money in a crypto presale. He sold all his shares immediately when the coin was released publicly, making a killing. All the retail investors saw the value of their coins plummet to zero soon after.
                    He used the liquid funds to buy a helicopter, and give it a custom paint job. Itâ€™s black, with bright orange flames going up the sides.
                    You really love your job.
